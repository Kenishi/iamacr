# IAmACR
## Reddit IAmA Calendar RSS App Engine

## What is it?

This is a Google App Engine project which shows the Reddit IAmA Calendar schedule as an RSS feed.

## How it works

Simply clone the project or download the release. Follow the setup procedures and deploy.

Your feed can be found at: **http://YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.appspot.com/iamacrss**

You can customize how many days in advance you want to receive an event feed by using
the *?t=#* query.

### Example
* http://YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.appspot.com/iamacrss?t=10 Show events occuring in the next 10 days
* http://YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.appspot.com/iamacrss?t=5 Show events occuring in the next 5 days

The *minimum* number of days is 1 and the *maximum* number of days is 60.

## Libraries in use

[BeautifulSoup HTML Parser](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)

[Countdown.js](http://countdownjs.org)

[JQuery](http://www.jquery.com)

## Setup

Obviously, clone or download the branch, and setup an app engine project in you developer console.
The library dependencies are already included in the /libs/ folder.

Next you need to enable the Calendar API for the project. This way you can query for the IAMA calendar in
the app. Next, create an API key in the project; it'll likely have to be a "browser key."

(You can setup referer domain limiting if you want so that only requests from your project's domain can use
the API key.)

Next, open up the app.yaml.

Update the `application` with your project name, save, and close.

Next, open up the main.py.

Update the `CALENDAR_API` with your API key.

Update the `LINK_URL` with your project name so that the app can find the right path to `event.html`

Update the `REFERER_DOMAIN` if you specified a domain restriction when creating your API Key.

Save main.py and close.

Deploy to the Google cloud and try accessing your feed with: `http://PROJECT_NAME.appspot.com/iamacrss`

## Modification

The feed is generated by the RSSHandler and the XML for the feed is generated in the `genXML()` (Header and Footer part of the feed)
 and `genEntryXML()` (Each item entry).

When you open a RSS link, the `/static/event.html` file is opened with the event id supplied as a query parameter. 
The `event.js` will pull down the event information, format it, and show it on the page. The greatest amount of customization can be done here.
